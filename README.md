## Run Locally
Open `index.html` in your browser (or serve the folder with a simple static server).

## Hosting Suggestions
Any static hosting works because this is plain HTML/CSS/JS.

- **GitHub Pages**: push the repo and enable Pages for the `main` branch.
- **Netlify**: drag-and-drop the project folder or connect a Git repo.
- **Vercel**: import the Git repo and deploy as a static site.
- **Cloudflare Pages**: connect the repo and deploy with no build step.

## Credits
This project was vibecoded with Opencode and GPT-5.2-codex.
